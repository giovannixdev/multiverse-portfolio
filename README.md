## Portfolio Introduction
I do what I do because I am passionate about creating and innovating new software solutions that can help to improve the efficiency and functionality of various businesses. I believe that technology is the key to success in many industries today and I am excited to be part of the process of developing these solutions.

I have worked with teams in a variety of settings and I have experience collaborating with different departments and working collaboratively with project managers to create successful solutions.
