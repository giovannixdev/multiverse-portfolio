## Project #1
- This app is an inventory management system designed to help make tracking and managing inventory easier. The app was created to help businesses streamline their inventory management, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.
- The app tracks inventory items, quantity of items, pricing and current stock levels. It updates the inventory when inventory items are added or sold. Prior to building the program, it was important to outline the scope and goals of the app, create mockups of the user interface, and develop detailed project requirements and features.

## Competencies
### JF 2
- Take a business or user problem, gather data to analyze the problem, and use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework, test the application, and use agile project management

- I used user data and use cases to brainstorm an inventory web app, then created a prototype using a prototyping tool. I tested the wireframes and UI to guarantee a satisfactory experience for the user. I implemented agile project management practices to remain on schedule with the project.
