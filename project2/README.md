## Project #2
My application is a video game discovery platform designed to provide users with a comprehensive list of the latest and most popular games. Users will be able to view game reviews, trailers, screenshots, and other game-related content. Additionally, users will be able to save and organize favorites in their library, enabling them to easily access a list of games that they are interested in or that they want to follow. Ultimately, we created this program to give gamers the ability to discover and explore all types of games without having to search for them all over the web.

- The design process involved forming the program, deciding upon the page structure, figuring out the essential features and capabilities needed, producing wireframes to assist in the development procedure, selecting the visual design, and writing out user stories to help direct the development. Once all these pieces were in place, the development process began.
